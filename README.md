## Document-Edge-Detection
This project focuses on extracting sheets from mixed images containing other unwanted objects, with the aim of enlarging them and processing them to make the images readable. The process includes using the Canny edge detection algorithm, preceded by preprocessing steps such as applying a Gaussian blur to reduce noise. This approach is effective in scenarios with challenging lighting conditions, suboptimal angles, or non-uniform backgrounds, ensuring better results in a wide range of situations.
